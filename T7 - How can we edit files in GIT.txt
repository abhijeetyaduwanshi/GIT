Now by this point of time we might have the files uploaded in the GIT and the repo is pretty stable.

Now if we review the files in the local dir and make a mind to change some of the files in the local dir and save them then the local dir and the repo will have same files but different contents in them.

To let git know about the changes then go the project dir in GIT BASH and

-> git status

This is going to show the files which are modified in the local dir and are different from the repo.

Now to add the changes in the file in the repo as well we do

-> git add <file name with extension>

This will add the changed file to the staging area.

Now we have to commit the changes added to the repo

-> git commit -m "modified file"

This will commit the changes to the repo.

Now if we check the status we will get the clean dir.

To make changes in multiple files we do the . ie period

-> git add .
-> git commit -m "modified multiple files"
