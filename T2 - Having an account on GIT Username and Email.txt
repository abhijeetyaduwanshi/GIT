Before starting with anything in GIT we have to have an account with GIT and its just putting up a Username and Email.
Whenever we are working on a GIT project with a group of people making changes to the same source code, this is a way to sort things out of who did what.

First we will add our Name and to do that open the GIT Bash
And do some configuration changes

-> git config --global user.name "Abhijeet Yaduwanshi"

This just means that take the configuration and change the name to Abhijeet Yaduwanshi
Global is used at the computer system level that we are working on, all the commits for all the projects worked on this computer will have name Abhijeet Yaduwanshi and not for one particular project

Next is setting up the Email and to do so

-> git config --global user.email "abhijeetyaduwanshi@gmail.com"

This has the same meaning as that of the name peoperty

Now to check if the settings are saved and we are good to go we will check the config settings and to do so

-> git config --list

This will give us list of all the config settings, we have to go and check for the user.name and user.email

If we want to check for a particular setting for say user.name do this

-> git config user.name

This will give us the user.name setting only

If in the way we face some problem and have to get some help, just ask git

-> git help

This will give us a list of resources that can really help us big time

And if we want to learn more about a resource from the list in the help section then take help with the resource name for example we have a resource in the list named commit and we want to learn more about commit resource

-> git help commit

This will probably open the HTML in the default browser explaining in deep about the commit resource
