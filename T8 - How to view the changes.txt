How to view the changes or the differences in the working dir and the git repo.
This is basically to see what changes are we making and how is it going to effect my project in the repo.

To see the changes first go to the project and make some changes in the project and then check the status of the project.

-> git status

That should show the modified status.

Now to check the difference between the files in the local dir and the repo we do the diff

-> git diff

This is going to show all the differences in the working copy and the file in the repo.

The differentiation in the lines changed are done in respect to the local dir.

The lines removed from the file in the local dir will be shown in red color and the line added to the file in the local dir will be shown in green color.

After we see the differences in the files and we are satisfied with all the changes then will go and add the files and commit the changes with a message and finally check the status.

-> git add .
-> git commit -m "modified files"
-> git status

Now after the commit if we check the differences we will not get anything because everything is up to date

-> git diff

Nothing will be shown

If we made changes to multiple files and we want to see the differences we will change multiple files and check the status

-> git status

This will show the files which are modified.

Now do the diff cammand to check the difference between the files in the local dir and the repo

-> git diff

This will show all the differences in all the files in the working copy and all the corresponding file in the repo.

Again the differentiation in the lines changed are done in respect to the local dir.

The lines removed from the files in the local dir will be shown in red color and the lines added to the files in the local dir will be shown in green color.

Now the changes that are done to the files are in ordered to the order the files are been changed eg: file tow is changed and then the file one is changed the order of the display will be file two and then file one.

After we see the differences in the files and we are satisfied with all the changes then will go and add the files and commit the changes with a message and finally check the status.

-> git add .
-> git commit -m "modified multiple files"
-> git status

Now after the commit if we check the differences we will not get anything because everything is up to date

-> git diff

Nothing will be shown
