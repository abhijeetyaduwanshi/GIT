Rename the files
If we rename the file with window explorer its very easy but a little confusing with GIT

If we go and rename the file in our working copy and check the status of the project

->git status

GIT tells us that we deleted the file and added a new file
Well actually we did do the same, renaming is remove the file and add the same file with a different name

To actually do this, we add the file with the new name first and then remove the file with the old name

->git add <newName.ext>
->git rm <oldName.ext>

Now if we check the status now the GIT will actually show us that the file was renamed from oldName.ext to newName.ext

-> renamed:		ondName.ext -> newName.ext

Now we can commit the changes

->git commit -m "renamed oldName to newName"

This is kind of confusing thats when moving the file comes in picture 

Move the files which is very simple

->git mv <oldName.ext> <newName.ext>

This means git please move the file to a new location

Now if we go and check the working folder (local dir) we see that the file is been renamed to newName and we did it with git and not manually.

So moving a file is kind of renaming it, kind of confusing again but simple

Now if we have to move the file to a different folder and rename it

->git mv <oldName.ext> <destination folder>/<newName.ext>
eg: git mv controller.txt controllers/homecontroller.txt

This is to tell GIT please move the file with the old name to the destination folder slash newName

Now if we check the status GIT will tell us that you have renamed and moved the file to the destination folder

DONT FORGET TO COMMIT
