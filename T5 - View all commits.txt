How to view all our previous commits? To do this make sure we are in our project folder and to view commits log

-> git log

This will give us the list of all the commits that we have done in the past along with the dates and the author.

If we are working in a team and we want to view commits from a particular author then

-> git log --author="name"

This is cool because we dont have to write authors full name their firstName or lastName can do the work.

Now we know that GIT is keeping track of all the changes in our local directory we can always keep a track of the condition of our projct

-> git status

This will give us the current condition of our project, basically thsi compares the local directory to the repo in GIT and show if there is any changes.

If we make any changes and check the status then this will be show in our bash in red color tha untracked files.
